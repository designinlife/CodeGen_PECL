---------

support compiler/linker flags setting using config programs
like pkg-config, mysql_config etc.

add configure test code within DATA section of <lib> and <header> tags?
e.g. for version checking?

<lib> shared=no 
  -> drop EXTNAME_SHARED_LIBADD parameter to PHP_ADD_LIBRARY_WITH_PATH
	=> requires further research, doesn't work this way
	==> how to add *static* libraries? 

check whether multiple logos work

use Console_Getargs instead of self extended Console_Getopt
  => still beta, not touched in a year, what is its stautus?

- check #line numbers in generated source with libxml
  -> error messages with meaningfull line numbers need this


Milestone 0.9
-------------

- <lib> and <header> tags *within* <with>...</with>  -> in progress
  => parsing ok now, needs config.m4 output tweaks

- rewrite the function prototype parser
  - object type specification (as in resources)      -> done
  - default values                                   -> done
  - 'void' treatment                                 -> done
  - '...' not handled                                -> done
  - array() as default value                         -> done
  - code generation for 'pass by refecence'          -> only for zval based types yet
  - '...' code generation                            -> only if first parameter yet
  - return by reference (for 5.1)                    -> not done yet   

- allow "src='path/to/file'" in more cases           -> needs checking

FREE_RESOURCE macro                                  -> done

allow defined PHP constants as default value         -> done

<define> tag -> #define + <constant>?                -> done by define attribute to <constant>

allow for embedded base64 or uu encoded logo specs   -> done

changeable function prefix?                          -> done

trick parser to verbatim pass on docbook contentent  -> done

add configure compile test for <resource>  to check  -> done
whether a given payload is a valid type?

SYSTEM Entity and XInclude support                   -> done (needs cleanup)

support for multiple <with> tags with distinct 
names, name defaults to extension name if not given  -> done

added version attribute to <extension>
to control parser features (replaces -x switch)      -> done

support <?code ... ?> as alternative to CDATA        -> done (needs check)

check whether <header> checks work                   -> done


Milestone 1.0
-------------

- support new win32 configure files              -> partly done (75%?)

- test suite

- class implementation and documentation support -> partly done (33%?)

- full support for stream wrappers and filters   -> started

- full support for .phpt test case generation    -> started

- support for new package.xml format             -> not done yet



not necessarily 1.0
-------------------

- change XML parsing to simplexml? or DOM? and delegate tag level parsing to sub-parsers?
  => not possible as these APIs do not provide line number information

- XSchema or RELAX/NG instead of DTD?

- VC++ 7 (VS.net) project files
  => not needed anymore as we now have config.w32?

- more licenses
  - GPL (with exception to allow linking against PHP)
  - QPL
  - MPL?
  - Artistic
  - ...
  - change <license> tag to either take a known license name 
    in the 'name' attribute or a free form license text as
    CDATA

- dual/multiple license support

- (c) copyright 

- have different levels of comment (and code?) generation
  similar to --no-help in ext_skel

- protos

  - option for 'old style' parameter parsing code generation ?
    (less readable but faster and more flexible)
    also needed if '...' is not the only parameter
    unless parse_params_ex with ZEND_PARSE_PARAMS_QUIET fills params anyway??
