Milestone 1.0
-------------

- <lib> and <header> tags *within* <with>...</with>  -> in progress
  => parsing ok now, needs config.m4 output tweaks

- change the resource variable names,            -> done
  check extension version to provide BC

- check #line numbers in generated source with libxml
  -> error messages with meaningfull line numbers need this

- allow "src='path/to/file'" in more cases           
  make sure it generates #line, too


- support new win32 configure files              -> partly done (75%?)

- test suite                                     -> done, but needs more tests/examples

- class implementation and documentation support 
 
  - <class>                                      -> done
  - <class extends="..."                         -> done
  - <class><implements interface="..."           -> done
  - <class><const>                               -> done
  - <class><property ...                         -> done
  - <class><function ...                         -> done
  - __construct needs special handling           -> done
  - <interface>                                  -> done
  - type hints                                   -> done

- full support for .phpt test case generation    -> done

  - <skipif>,<ini> in <function>                 -> done

  - <notest/> for functions not needing a test   -> done

- support for new package.xml 2.0 format         -> done, needs testing

- support extension dependencies                 -> done

- better property access macros                  -> done

- add a -l --lint option                         -> done

- write to tmpfiles first, only overwrite        -> done
  existing files if actual changes are 
  detected, preserve unchanged files 
  (to make "make" happy)


not necessarily 1.0
-------------------

- "object store" handling for private data       -> missing

- fix whitespace in generated code               -> started, work in progress

- multiple logos                                 -> started, needs checking

- add configure test code within DATA section of <lib> and <header> tags?
  e.g. for version checking?

- full support for stream wrappers and filters   -> started

- full support for session handler API

- full support for SAPI 

- return by reference (for 5.1 if it supports it)          

- VC++ 7 (VS.net) project files
  => not needed anymore as we now have config.w32?

- have different levels of comment (and code?) generation
  similar to --no-help in ext_skel

- protos

  - option for 'old style' parameter parsing code generation ?
    (less readable but faster and more flexible)
    also needed if '...' is not the only parameter
    unless parse_params_ex with ZEND_PARSE_PARAMS_QUIET fills params anyway??

- create seperate target dir for copied spec files

- allow addition of files to directories (eg. test),
  
- allow specification of file role instead of guessing by extension?

- support compiler/linker flags setting using config programs
  like pkg-config, mysql_config etc.

- <lib> shared=no 
  -> drop EXTNAME_SHARED_LIBADD parameter to PHP_ADD_LIBRARY_WITH_PATH
	=> requires further research, doesn't work this way
	==> how to add *static* libraries?
